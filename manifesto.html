<h1>Josh for morale officer </h1>

<h2>What will I do?</h2>

<h3>Morale office hours</h3>
<p>As a single morale officer I will fully utilise the half day of morale time I have each week.
    I'll publicise this information, making it obvious when people can come talk about morale activities.
    Using the full half day will guarantee I'm working as hard as possible to make morale great.
    Additionally, I will host a morale tea and cake every other week.
    Tea and cake is a great tool for coming up with crowdsourcing the process of coming up with exciting morale events. 
    They were vital during the start of the pandemic.
</p>

<h3>Quantity &amp; Quality</h3>
<p>
    Obviously, the large morale events&mdash;the party, the picnic, and Christmas&mdash;are vitally important.
    However, I think equally important are the smaller, more frequent morale events. Board game nights, Mafia, Film nights... I think these define Softwire as much as the larger events.
    I plan on having as many of these as possible, <strong>pledging</strong> to have at least 1 "regular" morale event per week.
</p>
<p>
    This won't be possible on my own, Softwire morale is at it's greatest when as many people are involved as possible.
    I want to make it as easy as possible for people to organise events that they want to see happen, 
    and emphasise just how easy it is to host an event. One of the key responsibilities of the morale officer(s) is empowering others to do morale.
</p>
<h3>Picnics</h3>
<p>
    I am very excited for Glasonbury, but it is a replacement for the company holiday, not the picnic. 
    I <strong>pledge</strong> that, covid regulations permitting, we will have a company picnic before the end of summer.
    If covid regulations are such that we can't have a picnic with the whole company then I will organise multiple, smaller ones.
</p>
<h3><span class="red">P</span><span class="orange">r</span><span class="green">i</span><span class="blue">d</span><span class="violet">e</span></h3>
<p>I <strong>pledge</strong> to organise a Softwire group to go to Pride in London in 2021.</p>
<h3>Third Friday Diversity</h3>
<p>Third Fridays in the pub are great. But the really memorable Third Fridays are the special ones, the ones we have in the office. I think we should increase the diversity of events we have for Third Friday.
    More Third Fridays in the office, and other more exciting third Fridays - Third Friday as an evening on the heath, At a drag cabaret, As an afternoon/ evening tea, as bingo!
</p>
<h3>Let's play together</h3>
<p>
    We've had multiple Let's plays as a company, Obra Dinn, Baba is you... I intend to organise more of these, especially as lunchtime events.
    As part of this I intend to organise Pandemic legacy at lunchtime groups.
</p>
<h3>Re-starter events</h3>
<p>
    There are a bunch of new starters who only had an online welcome event. I will work with each of these cohorts to organise a re-starter event of their choice, whether that's a "normal" pub trip or something more exciting to welcome them officially and properly 
</p>
<h3>Your ideas here!</h3>
<p>As morale officer I'd be more than happy to help other people make morale into whatever they think it should be! If you've got ideas for what you'd like the next year of morale to look like, please share them on the <a href="https://softwiremorale.slack.com/archives/C026NB25X2T">#josh-for-morale</a> slack.</p>
