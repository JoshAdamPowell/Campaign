<h1>Josh for morale officer </h1>

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>

<p>I'm Josh, I've worked at Softwire for 3 and a half years.
    I was the morale officer for 2019/2020 and I'm running again!
    I've organised many, many moral events during, before and after my term as morale officer, so I'm extremely experienced with running morale events.
    I also worked hard during the first half of 2020 to transition us to a remote morale world.
